# Metalibm Description Language

Metalibm Description Language (MDL) is the entry point for Metalibm

# Basics MDL constructs
MDL is based on operation constructs such as **Addition**, **Multiplication**, **Variable**, **Constant** or **Return** for example.

### Expression
MDL expression are composition of leaf nodes (**Constant**, **Variable**) with expression nodes.

    # a variable called x with undefined precision
    x = Variable("x")
    # Addition between x and the numerical value 3.
    # Metalibm will promote 3 from numerical value to Constant node
    y = Addition(x, 3)
    # The previous expression can be written with implicit operations
    z = x + 3


### Statement
Control flow can be described in MDL using Statement constructs such as **ConditionBlock**, **Statement**, **Return**.

    # if (cond) then return a else return b
    scheme = ConditionBlock(
	    cond,
	    Return(a),
	    Return(b)
	)

## Attributes

### Precision
MDL Nodes can be annotated with attributes which specifies their properties. For example you can specify the precision of a node by using **precision** attribute.

    # a single precision variable called "t"
    t = Variable("t", precision=ML_Binary32)

Basic MDL precisions include: **ML_Binary32** (float), **ML_Binary64** (double), **ML_Int32** (int32_t), **ML_UInt32** (uint32_t*), **ML_UInt64**, **ML_Int64**.
MDL also contains compound precisions: **ML_DoubleDouble**, **ML_TripleDouble** and vector formats: **v\<i\>float32** (vector of single precision elements),  **v<i>float64** (vector of double precision elements), **v\<i\>[u]int32**, **v\<i\>[u]int64**, **v\<i\>bool** with **\<i\>** in 2, 3, 4, 8. 

### Tag
You can force the name of a node by using the **tag** attribute.

    # An addition tagged "unique_sum", this name should appear in the generated code
    unique_sum = Addition(t, x, tag="unique_sum")
